# language_experimentation

Includes work done related to experimenting and learning different languages such as Python, Java, and webpage editing languages like HTML. Also includes the giant and poorly made Legend of Zelda spin-off I made during an introductory CS class.  

I shall attempt to learn as many languages as possible, and hope to get better at Python, Java, and to learn C++.
